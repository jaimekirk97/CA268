"""
    Selection sort algorithm

    This version of selection sort simultaneously gets the smallest and the largest
    and swaps them with the first and last element respectively.
    
    Timing tests show that it is about 7% faster on random input of size 10000
    
    Is it worth the extra effort?
    No. Use an NlogN algorithm instead for 1000* improvement.
